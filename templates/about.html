                A year is the time it takes for a planet to revolve around the sun. Further, a day is the time it takes for a planet to turn once around its rotational axis.

                We use  62138156134 (magic constant) + unix timestamp (seconds since unix epoch) to calculate the total number of seconds that have passed since 1.1.0001 AD.
            </p>

                Given the orbital period in Hz we can calculate the current year:
            </p>
            <p>
                n_years = s_passed / orbital_period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Days are calculated from the remainder of this division:
            </p>
            <p>
                n_days = (remainder * orbital_period) / len_day
            </p>
            <p>
                All orbital data was obtained from:
                http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi
            </p>
            <p>
                According to a rudimentary test, the date on Earth will not be off by more than 1 day during the next few years.
